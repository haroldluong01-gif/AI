# The purpose of a tokenizer:
# Break text into smaller pieces called tokens so that the AI
# model can process the text.

# The tokenizer will:
# 1. Take the raw text.
# 2. Split the text into words and punctuation.
# 3. Build a vocabulary.
# 4. Convert tokens into integer IDs.
# 5. Convert IDs back into tokens.

# The tokenizer sits between the raw text and the neural network.

# Pipeline:


# Notice how there are at least two empty lines above the class
# header (class Tokenizer).

    # The purpose of the __init__() method is to initialise the
    # state of an object.

        #     "The": 2,
        #     "cat": 1,
        #     "sat": 5,
        #     ".": 0
        # }

        # token_to_id answers:
        # What number represents this token?
