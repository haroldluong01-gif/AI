# Re stands for regular expression. 
# # Regular expressions are patterns that describe text we want to find.
# \w+ finds one or more word characters, such as letters or numbers.
# [^\w\s] finds one character that is not a word character or whitespace.
# The | means "or", so we find either a word or a punctuation character.


# The purpose of a tokenizer:
# Break text into smaller pieces called tokens so that the AI
# model can process the text.

# The tokenizer will:
# 1. Take the raw text.
# 2. Split the text into words and punctuation.
# 3. Build a vocabulary.
# 4. Convert tokens into integer IDs.
# 5. Convert IDs back into tokens.

# The tokenizer sits between the raw text and the neural network.

# Pipeline:


# Notice how there are at least two empty lines above the class
# header (class Tokenizer).
